# BP-Automation-work
A few scripts I wrote in my position at Brooklyn Park to automate GIS processes:

NWPS_Sync -- syncing New World Public Safety GIS centerlines and address points with enterprise geodatabase via field mapping.

Quintiles -- automate yearly data updates.

SanitaryMap -- automate weekly map and spreadsheet update for sanitary line field work.

# BP-Automation-work
A few scripts I wrote in my position at Brooklyn Park to automate GIS processes:

NWPS_Sync -- syncing New World Public Saftely GIS centerlines and address points with enterprise geodatabase via field mapping. /n
Quintiles -- automate yearly data updates. /n
SanitaryMap -- automate weekly map and spreadsheet update for sanitary line field work.
